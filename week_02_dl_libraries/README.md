## Lectures

**Optimisation recap**

Optimisation alternative 1:
* [coursera/intro-to-deep-learning/stochastic-gradient-descent](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning/lecture/QXOet/stochastic-gradient-descent)
* [coursera/intro-to-deep-learning/gradient-descent-extensions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning/lecture/lYGBt/gradient-descent-extensions)

Optimisation alternative 2:
* [iad-deep-learning optimisation](https://youtu.be/i8W_ZgiajOs?list=PLEwK9wdS5g0qa3PIhR6HBDJD_QnrfP8Ei&t=770) Start lecture from 12:50. CNN (convolutional neural networks) we do not need for now.

**Regularization**
* [coursera/intro-to-deep-learning/model-regularization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning/lecture/qW00l/model-regularization)
* [iad-deep-learning Regularization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ljQTZ8HT-A&list=PLEwK9wdS5g0qa3PIhR6HBDJD_QnrfP8Ei&index=28) You can skip the last 10 minutes about augmentation for now.
